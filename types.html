   <summary> <h2>Skirts and pallazos</h2></summary>
<aside>
<p>The more often we see the things around us - even the beautiful and wonderful things - the more they become invisible to us. That is why we often take for granted the beauty of this world: the flowers, the trees, the birds, the clouds - even those we love. Because we see things so often, we see them less and less.

    <p>The heat, humidity and the rain are not a good combination and we suggest your avoid those fitted jeans and pants and let loose with these quirky desi skirts and pallazo. They instantly add a bohemian vibe and to master the look wear them with plain black or white t-shirts. Bandhej being the symbol of Rajasthani textile work dominates the markets.

    <p>We all love the all white look with a bright colourful dupatta and ever since Alia Bhatt donned this look in one of her movies it’s definitely a must in any wedding. Scarves are generally worn in winter but fashion has no boundaries and different seasons are just an excuse to buy more clothes.</p>
