                    <p style="color:Black; font-family:Maiandra GD;font-size:20px;text-align:justified">To cope with the ever-changing technologies, the markets and consumer are rapidly evolving from traditional, static, demographic-based criteria to more towards dynamic, modern, mood, lifestyle and psycho graphic influences.
<br>
Fashion trend forecasting resources help predict trends in the fashion industry. Fashion & trend forecasting is the prediction of mood, behavior and buying habits of the consumer at particular time of season. It is no longer a question of finding your markets or consumers by age, geography or income, but looking into how and what they buy, based on their culture, mood, beliefs, occasion & geographic locations, it is also dependent on fashion cycle and plays a major role in introductory phase of recurring fashion cycles.

Understanding fashion trends forecast is one of the most arduous and calculative work for all, I know most of top business houses around the world totally rely on designers for understanding the same, but on the other side there are others who dont believe in it at all. In current times when we look at technology we know nothing is by chance and there are people who are working behind the scenes, day and night to make things appear easy and affordable to us. Question which often comes to our mind is which trend forecast to use and how we can understand it better. Many technological forecasting methods have been reported in various forecast related books & mentioned in literature of many countries, and they have been successfully applied widely. As trend forecasting results are mainly influenced by the forecasting method used by the end user, it is of utmost importance to determine the method that will be most appropriate to a business model you adopt. </p>

                              <p style="color:Black; font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:20px;text-align:justified"><i>'Nothing is constant except for change!' Fashion is nothing but a constantly changing trend. This term is associated with clothes and accessories majority of the times. People relate fashion to what they wear. Though fashion is a wider concept, it has narrowed down to fabric, apparel, and accessories in modern times.
<br>

Oleg Cassini, a reputed French-born, American fashion designer quotes,
<br>
"Fashion anticipates, and elegance is a state of mind... a mirror of the time in which we live, a translation of the future, and should never be static."
<br>

Great philosophers have come up with different definitions for fashion. But all of them hold one concept in common - looking and feeling good! If you are fashionable, you are confident of your looks. You are sure that you are conveying the right impression before the other person. Being fashionable will certainly help you in taking the first step towards your goal.
<br>

Fashion has a long history of trials and errors. What was considered fashionable a few decades back might be synonymous to killing fashion in modern times! Similarly, what is considered fashionable in modern times may be like a fashion suicide for people living a few decades back! The era, beliefs held by the people living in it, and the culture in that era and in that region plays a considerable role in influencing its fashion trends.
